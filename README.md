# vimsetup
Includes all vim-related plugins, configurations, and magic optimized for this repo's owner ([@tnptop](https://github.com/tnptop)).
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) is used as the plugin manager.
# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tnptop/vimsetup.git /path/to/clone
cd /path/to/clone/vimsetup
./install.sh
```
# Update
Pull the latest commits from remote to update. Symlink of `.vimrc` should do its work.
To install new plugins, run `vim +PluginInstall +qall`.
